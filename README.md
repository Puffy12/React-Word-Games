## Introduction

React Word Games is a web application that brings together a variety of word games, including Hangman, Wordle, and Crossword puzzles. Built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, this app provides a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

## Setup

### React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}

Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`

Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`

Install `eslint-plugin-react` and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start playing the games
